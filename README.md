# hello-world
Hello coders! My name is Jelena and this is my first repository! Be gentle, please!
I live in a beautiful country Serbia, which I love very much! You should all come to visit it!

I opened this account wishing to work on my projects collaboratively with coders, to help and get some help from others! ;-)

I passed through html, css and css3. Right now, I am learning Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery and PHP. When I've started, I've knew that this is not going to be an easy task for me. But, I am doing my best.

So, this is about me in short. I hope that being a part of this project will be a lot of work and fun! Have a nice day everybody! Bue for now!
